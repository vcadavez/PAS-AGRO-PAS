# The Making of Fragile Agro-ecosystems Productive, Adaptive and Sustainable: Multifunctional Agro-pastoralism <a href='https://github.com/vcadavez/PAS-AGRO-PAS'><img src='./img/hex-logo.png' align="right" height="138.5" /></a>


This repository gathers all outputs produced by the PRIMA EU-funded project: [The Making of Fragile Agro-ecosystems Productive, Adaptive and Sustainable: Multifunctional Agro-pastoralism (PAS-AGRO-PAS)](https://prima-med.org/what-we-do/years/funded-projects-2022/).

The [PAS-AGRO-PAS GitHub community](https://github.com/vcadavez/PAS-AGRO-PAS) involves protocols, technical and scientific articles, and datasets on:

i.  Agro-pastoral production systems;
ii. Management and diversification of crop and pasture production;
iii. Productivity of livestock local breeds;
iv. Raise the economic potential and generational renewal of agro-pastoralism; and 
v. Promote the transition of traditional agro-pastoralism to the `Agriculture 4.0`.
